A girl behind a wall of books, enveloped in self doubt, wishing to be free from herself.\nTwo paths that you'd think would never meet but what if in one, out of infinite realities, their fate intertwined? Watch as how the relationship between the two develops as they try to overcome whatever obstacle that life throws at them and...

Alongside the debut of a rising star who goes by the name Morphonema.\n\nAlso accompanying the game are almost a Dozen new CGs and custom Backgrounds.

        "Description": "This is essentially a psychological, realistic, choice heavy take on the world of DDLC, with an emphasis on worldbuilding. Characters such as MC's mother and teacher - the suave Mr Sakurai - have been added, all to actually make DDLC feel like a proper, realistic world. With a heavy emphasis from fellow visual novel Katawa Shoujo, be expected to be taken on a huge rollercoaster of events with your favourite Doki! Except Monika - sorry about that.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Fully fledged routes spanning over 6 months in-game time for Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki. With the whole mod totalling ~550,000 words, this is the longest DDLC mod to date.\n\n- Multiple endings for each Doki - tread lightly, as your actions have consequences.\n\n- Beautiful new CGs for all 3 Dokis, along with brand new backgrounds, weather effects and phone sprites.\n\n- H scenes for Sayori and Yuri (but don't worry, you can toggle them off if you're not into that stuff) - not just mindless fanservice, either.\n\n- A brand new 40~ track OST from our team's musicians, with heavy influences from Katawa Shoujo, Pokemon, Corpse Party and other well known games.\n\n- A fully fleshed out version of the characters; ever wanted to know what the girls are like in school? Their hopes and dreams for the future? Join them in their highs and console them through their lows.\n\n- Extra goodies to be found within - there's a lot that we've kept as a surprise!",
